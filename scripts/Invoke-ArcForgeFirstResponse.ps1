# ArcForge First Response
# ArcForge First Response Report v0.49
#
# v0.49 System evidence parser boundary notes:
# - v0.49 moves only ConvertTo-ArcForgeSystemEvidenceRecord into
#   scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1 after confirming it depends only on its
#   input line, static report-line parsing rules, string trimming, and basic
#   object creation.
# - New-ArcForgeHtmlReport, New-ArcForgeSystemEvidenceHtml,
#   New-ArcForgeSystemDetailSectionHtml, the final HTML template, embedded CSS,
#   report output paths, scoring, console output, TXT output, detection logic,
#   System labels, anchors, card order, layout, default-open behavior, and
#   collapsed detail behavior are intended to remain unchanged.
#
# v0.48 HTML report System detail section boundary notes:
# - v0.48 inspects New-ArcForgeSystemDetailSectionHtml as the next possible
#   System-specific HTML helper boundary.
# - The helper remains in New-ArcForgeSystemEvidenceHtml for now because it
#   still depends on the renderer-local ConvertTo-ArcForgeSystemEvidenceRecord
#   parser used to turn existing report lines into System evidence rows.
# - This keeps the detail-section boundary explicit without creating a hidden
#   module dependency on renderer-local parsing logic.
# - New-ArcForgeHtmlReport, New-ArcForgeSystemEvidenceHtml, the final HTML
#   template, embedded CSS, report output paths, scoring, console output, TXT
#   output, detection logic, System labels, anchors, card order, layout,
#   default-open behavior, and collapsed detail behavior are intended to remain
#   unchanged.
#
# v0.47 HTML report System evidence-only row boundary notes:
# - v0.47 moves the small static System evidence-only row helper into
#   scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1 after confirming it only depends on an
#   explicit record, optional display label, and the existing HTML encoding
#   helper.
# - New-ArcForgeHtmlReport, New-ArcForgeSystemEvidenceHtml, and
#   New-ArcForgeSystemDetailSectionHtml remain in the main script in this
#   release.
# - The full System evidence assembly, detail section builder, final HTML
#   template, embedded CSS, report output paths, scoring, console output, TXT
#   output, detection logic, System labels, anchors, card order, layout,
#   default-open behavior, and collapsed detail behavior are intended to remain
#   unchanged.
# v0.46 HTML report System status row boundary notes:

#   main script in this release.
# - The full System evidence assembly, detail section builder, final HTML
#   template, embedded CSS, report output paths, scoring, console output, TXT
#   output, detection logic, System labels, anchors, card order, layout,
#   default-open behavior, and collapsed detail behavior are intended to remain
#   unchanged.
# v0.43 HTML report System Overview boundary notes:

#
# v0.41 HTML section readiness data boundary notes:
# - v0.41 moves Get-ArcForgeSectionReadiness into
#   scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1 after confirming it only depends on its
#   own parameters and the existing flattened-line helper.
# - New-ArcForgeHtmlReport remains in the main script in this release.
# - No HTML layout, CSS, console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic,
#   parsing behavior, or report behavior changes are intended.
#

#
# v0.36 HTML safety helper extraction notes:
# - v0.36 creates scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1 as the first active HTML
#   report helper module.
# - This pass extracts only the smallest HTML safety helper first:
#   ConvertTo-HtmlSafeText.
# - New-ArcForgeHtmlReport remains in the main script in this release.
# - No HTML layout, CSS, console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic,
#   parsing behavior, or report behavior changes are intended.
#
# v0.35 HTML renderer slice prep notes:
# - v0.35 keeps New-ArcForgeHtmlReport in the main script.
# - No HTML renderer code is extracted in this release.
# - This pass maps New-ArcForgeHtmlReport into safe future extraction slices.
# - scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1 is still planned only.
# - Intended change type: annotation-only / boundary-prep only.
# - No console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic, parsing behavior,
#   HTML, CSS, or report behavior changes are intended.
#
# v0.34 report parsing module extraction notes:
# - v0.34 extracts the read-only report parsing helper into
#   scripts/ArcForge.ReportParsing.ps1.
# - This keeps the main script focused on orchestration while preserving the
#   existing console/TXT-to-HTML report pipeline.
# - Parsing should continue to interpret completed report lines only. It should
#   not write console/TXT output, mutate report lines, change scoring, run
#   endpoint checks, or own HTML/CSS presentation.
# - No console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic, HTML, CSS, or
#   report behavior changes are intended.
#
# v0.33 HTML report extraction prep notes:
# - v0.33 documents the internal structure of New-ArcForgeHtmlReport before any
#   future extraction into scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1.
# - scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1 is still planned only; no HTML code is
#   extracted in this release.
# - This pass adds a compact renderer function inventory and region notes so the
#   future HTML extraction can happen in smaller, safer pieces.
# - No console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic, parsing behavior,
#   HTML, CSS, or report behavior changes are intended.

# v0.32 HTML report boundary prep notes:
# - v0.32 documents the static HTML rendering layer that sits after
#   report parsing and HTML-only view model preparation.
# - scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1 is planned only; no HTML code is
#   extracted in this release.
# - HTML rendering should own presentation, markup, embedded CSS, status
#   visuals, navigation, report sections, and final static document assembly.
# - HTML rendering should consume already-prepared report data. It should not
#   collect endpoint evidence, run checks, change scoring, mutate report lines,
#   write console/TXT output, own Software Catalog detection, or own future
#   Index baseline verification logic.
# - No console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic, parsing behavior,
#   HTML, CSS, or report behavior changes are intended.
#
# v0.31 report parsing boundary prep notes:
# - v0.31 documents the read-only parsing layer that sits between
#   $ReportLines and the static HTML report view model.
# - scripts/ArcForge.ReportParsing.ps1 is planned only; no parsing code is
#   extracted in this release.
# - Parsing should interpret completed report lines and return structured data
#   for HTML rendering. It should not write console/TXT output, mutate report
#   lines, change scoring, or own HTML/CSS presentation.
# - No console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic, HTML, CSS, or
#   report behavior changes are intended.
#
# v0.30 console report module extraction notes:
# - v0.30 extracts the safest console/TXT report helper functions into
#   scripts/ArcForge.ConsoleReport.ps1.
# - This creates the second active ArcForge support module.
# - Behavior should remain identical to v0.29.
# - No console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic, HTML, CSS, or
#   report behavior changes are intended.
#
# v0.29 console/TXT report boundary prep notes:
# - This pass documents the console and TXT output boundary before any future
#   extraction into scripts/ArcForge.ConsoleReport.ps1.
# - No console strings, TXT strings, scoring, detection logic, HTML, CSS, or
#   report behavior changes are intended.
# - Keep output-writing centralized through Add-ReportLine, Write-Result,
#   Write-Section, and Write-Summary where practical.
# - Health-check code should collect evidence and call output helpers; it should
#   not own formatting decisions long term.
#
# v0.28 software catalog module extraction notes:
# - v0.28 extracts the Software Catalog helper functions into
#   scripts/ArcForge.SoftwareCatalog.ps1.
# - This is ArcForge's first real modularization step.
# - Behavior should remain identical to v0.27.
# - No detection logic, output, scoring, or report rendering changes are intended.
#
# v0.27 software catalog boundary cleanup notes:
# - This pass checks whether the Software Catalog helpers are clean enough to
#   become the first safe extraction candidate in a future release.
# - The goal is still preparation only: no module files, dot-sourcing, runtime
#   parameters, detection changes, output changes, or scoring changes are added.
# - Keep catalog helpers independent from console output, TXT output, HTML
#   rendering, readiness scoring, and runtime orchestration.
#
# v0.26 function ownership mapping notes:
# - This pass maps current functions and major code regions to likely future
#   module owners before any actual file extraction begins.
# - Comments marked "Future module owner" are planning annotations only.
# - Do not treat these comments as active dot-sourcing, imports, or runtime
#   dependencies.
#
# v0.25 maintainability pass notes:
# - This file is still intentionally a single script for the pre-modularization stage.
# - The section banners below are a map of the current monolith, not new behavior.
# - Future modularization should use these boundaries as extraction candidates.
# - Do not change console, TXT, HTML output, engine logic, or scoring as part of
#   structure-only cleanup work.

#
# MODULE BOUNDARY INVENTORY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This inventory documents current and likely future file/module boundaries for ArcForge.
# Most entries are still planning notes. Entries marked as extracted are active
# module files used by the main script.
#
# The purpose of this pass is to reduce risk before modularization by making
# the intended ownership boundaries visible while the project moves from one
# large script toward small, deliberate modules.
#
# Keep root launcher:
# - arcforge.ps1
#   - User-facing entry point.
#   - Should stay small and call the main script.
#
# Keep current main orchestrator for now:
# - scripts/Invoke-ArcForgeFirstResponse.ps1
#   - Current single-file implementation.
#   - Should remain the active orchestrator until extraction is deliberate and
#     tested in small steps.
#
# Future support modules may eventually include:
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Runtime.ps1
#   - Parameter and run metadata setup.
#   - Report path setup.
#   - Shared constants used across the run.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.ConsoleReport.ps1
#   - Extracted in v0.30.
#   - Add-ReportLine.
#   - Write-Result.
#   - Write-Section.
#   - Write-Summary.
#   - Console and TXT output formatting.
#   - Current direct run-header and finalization Write-Host lines should be
#     reviewed before extraction so the visible console output stays identical.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.SoftwareCatalog.ps1
#   - Extracted in v0.28.
#   - Owns Software Catalog parsing and software detection helpers.
#   - Test-SoftwareInstalled.
#   - Test-YesValue.
#   - Get-CatalogValue.
#   - Get-DisplayNamePatterns.
#   - Split-DetectionCandidates.
#   - Get-SoftwareDetectionConfig.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.ReportParsing.ps1
#   - Extracted in v0.34.
#   - Owns Get-ArcForgeReportSections.
#   - Owns read-only transforms from raw report lines into section collections
#     and HTML-ready report data.
#   - Should not write console/TXT output, mutate report lines, change scoring,
#     run endpoint checks, or own HTML/CSS presentation.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1
#   - Created in v0.36.
#   - Owns ConvertTo-HtmlSafeText.
#   - Owns New-StatusClass.
#   - Owns New-StatusBadgeHtml.
#   - Future owner for New-ArcForgeHtmlReport.
#   - Future owner for shared HTML safety helpers.
#   - Future owner for additional status badge/severity visual rendering.
#   - Future owner for summary, Recommended Actions, Raw Findings, and final
#     static HTML document assembly.
#   - Future owner for embedded CSS and dependency-free static report markup.
#   - v0.35 staged extraction slice map:
#     1. HTML safety / escaping helpers.
#     2. Status badge / severity visual helpers.
#     3. Flattened finding helpers.
#     4. Readiness and top-summary helpers.
#     5. Recommended Actions helpers.
#     6. Raw Findings helpers.
#     7. System HTML helpers.
#     8. Software Readiness HTML helpers.
#     9. Report Navigation helpers.
#     10. Embedded CSS block.
#     11. Static HTML template assembly.
#     12. File write / output path handling.
#   - Should consume parsed/view-model report data. It should not collect
#     evidence, run checks, mutate $ReportLines, write console/TXT output, change
#     scoring, own Software Catalog detection, or own future Index verification.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Html.System.ps1
#   - System-specific HTML rendering helpers.
#   - Build-SystemEvidenceSection.
#   - System overview and detail cards.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Html.Navigation.ps1
#   - Sidebar navigation helpers.
#   - Readiness segment helpers.
#   - Section anchor and link construction.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Checks.System.ps1
#   - System identity.
#   - Uptime and Vital Signs.
#   - Process Health.
#   - Core Services.
#   - Storage.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Checks.Network.ps1
#   - Gateway reachability.
#   - External reachability.
#   - DNS resolution.
#   - Future offline-safe networking interpretation.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Checks.Software.ps1
#   - Software Readiness checks.
#   - Profile and catalog evaluation orchestration.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Checks.Security.ps1
#   - Firewall posture.
#   - Antivirus provider evidence.
#   - Local administrators review.
#
# - scripts/ArcForge.Checks.Updates.ps1
#   - Windows Update services.
#   - Pending reboot evidence.
#   - Hotfix evidence.
#
# Future extraction rule of thumb:
# - Move one boundary at a time.
# - Run both General and Developer profiles after each extraction.
# - Compare console, TXT, HTML, scoring, and generated report behavior before
#   continuing to the next boundary.
#
# Recommended future extraction order:
# 1. scripts/ArcForge.SoftwareCatalog.ps1
#    - Extracted in v0.28. Keep this module focused on catalog parsing and
#      detection helpers only.
# 2. scripts/ArcForge.ConsoleReport.ps1
#    - Extracted in v0.30. Keep this module focused on console/TXT helper
#      functions only for now.
# 3. scripts/ArcForge.ReportParsing.ps1
#    - Extracted in v0.34. Keep this module focused on read-only transforms
#      from report lines into section collections and HTML-ready report data.
# 4. scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1
#    - Created in v0.36.
#    - v0.36 extracts ConvertTo-HtmlSafeText as the first safe helper.
#    - v0.37 candidate: extract Raw Findings and Recommended Actions helpers.
#    - v0.38 candidate: extract System HTML helpers.
#    - v0.39 candidate: extract Software Readiness HTML helpers.
#    - v0.40 candidate: move the remaining final HTML renderer into the module.
#    - Keep the full HTML template pipeline late because it is presentation-
#      coupled and fragile.
# 5. scripts/ArcForge.Checks.*.ps1
#    - Move evidence collection by domain only after helper ownership is clear.
#
# Future Index compatibility note:
# - The Index is not implemented in v0.36.
# - Future baseline verification will need clean access to collected endpoint
#   evidence before it is rendered into TXT or HTML.
# - Avoid making report rendering the only place where evidence meaning exists.
# - Long term, checks should produce structured findings that can support:
#   current-state reports, readiness scoring, and Index variance comparisons.

# =============================================================================
# 00. Parameter Input
# =============================================================================
# Future module owner: scripts/ArcForge.Runtime.ps1
# Notes:
# - Parameter ownership should remain close to runtime/orchestration setup until
#   extraction is intentional. Do not add Index or BootType parameters in v0.36.

# - This region prepares run metadata and report paths used by all outputs.

# =============================================================================
# Software Catalog helper functions now live in:

# terms, that means PowerShell reads the helper file first so these functions
# are available when the Software Readiness section needs them.

# 04. Report Line Parsing Helpers
# =============================================================================
# Report parsing helper functions now live in:

#
# The main script dot-sources that module near the top of this file. In plain
# terms, that means PowerShell reads the helper file first so New-ArcForgeHtmlReport
# can use the parser without keeping that helper in the main script.
#
# Parsing remains a read-only interpretation layer between completed console/TXT
# report lines and the static HTML report renderer.

# =============================================================================
# 05. Static HTML Report Generation Pipeline
# =============================================================================
# Future module owner: scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1
# FUTURE MODULE BOUNDARY: New-ArcForgeHtmlReport is currently the container for
# static HTML rendering. This area decides how already-prepared report data looks
# in the local HTML report. Split this carefully later; do not mix it with
# health-check collection logic.
#
# HTML rendering ownership notes:
# - HTML escaping / encoding helpers.
# - Status badge and severity visual treatment.
# - Report Navigation markup.
# - Summary/readiness markup.
# - Recommended Actions markup.
# - Raw Findings markup.
# - System Overview and System detail card markup.
# - Software Readiness grouping/card markup.
# - Collapsible/details markup.
# - Embedded CSS.
# - Final self-contained static HTML document assembly.
#
# HTML rendering should not:
# - Collect endpoint evidence.
# - Run checks.
# - Change readiness scoring.
# - Mutate $ReportLines.
# - Write console/TXT output.
# - Own Software Catalog detection logic.
# - Own future Index baseline verification logic.
#
# Guardrails for this area:
# - No JavaScript.
# - No CDN assets.
# - No external fonts, icons, images, or dependencies.
# - No changes to console output, TXT output, readiness scoring, parsing, or checks.
#
# v0.33 renderer structure inventory:
# - Safety/general helpers:

#   - New-ArcForgeReportNavigationHtml.
# - Final assembly:
#   - HTML-only data preparation.
#   - Embedded CSS.
#   - Static HTML template assembly.
#   - File write to the requested OutputPath.
#
# Extraction note:
# - Keep these regions intact for v0.35. Later releases can move one renderer
#   region at a time after confirming report behavior stays identical.
#
# v0.35 safe future extraction order:
# 1. Move HTML safety and small status/severity helpers first.
# 2. Move Raw Findings and Recommended Actions helpers after that foundation is stable.
# 3. Move System-specific HTML helpers as their own tested slice.
# 4. Move Software Readiness HTML helpers separately from System rendering.
# 5. Move navigation helpers after section ids and anchors are verified.
# 6. Move final template assembly, embedded CSS, and file output last.

# Generates the self-contained static HTML report.
#
# This function turns the raw report lines, parsed/view-model data, and summary
# counters into a polished local HTML file. It does not use JavaScript, external
# CSS, or external assets. The HTML acts as a future GUI prototype while keeping
# ArcForge simple and local.
#
# Input:
# - OutputPath: Destination .html file path.
# - ReportId, ComputerName, CurrentUser, BattlestationProfile, GeneratedAt:

    # 05.01 HTML Safety and Generic Rendering Helpers
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # v0.39 note:
    # - ConvertTo-HtmlSafeText, New-StatusClass, New-StatusBadgeHtml,
    #   ConvertTo-ArcForgeHtmlFindingList, and Get-ArcForgeFlattenedLines now
    #   live in scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1.
    # - The remaining nested helpers stay here until later staged extractions.
    # - These helpers are intentionally presentation-only. They convert
    #   already-captured report data into safe static HTML fragments.

    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # 05.02 Readiness Overview Helpers
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # v0.35 future slice: readiness and top-summary helpers.
    # These helpers build the dashboard-style readiness cards from existing raw
    # report lines. They do not rerun checks or change scoring rules.

    # Get-ArcForgeSectionReadiness and New-ArcForgeReadinessOverviewHtml now live
    # in scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1. The readiness data boundary is kept
    # separate from the large final HTML renderer so this release does not touch
    # the fragile report template, CSS, navigation, or file output logic.

    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # 05.03 Endpoint Summary Helper
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # This helper renders the top identity/status badge. It should stay focused
    # on report metadata and final OK/WARN/FAIL counts.

    # Builds the compact v0.20 Endpoint Summary badge shown at the top of the
    # HTML report.
    #
    # Why this exists:
    # - The first screen of the HTML report should feel like a quick endpoint
    #   identity card, similar to what a tech might scan in an RMM tool.
    # - A tech should be able to immediately identify the computer, current user,
    #   selected Battlestation Profile, generated time, overall status, and check
    #   totals without reading a large grid of separate cards.
    #
    # Input:
    # - Report metadata that was already being displayed in the Report Summary.
    # - Existing OK/WARN/FAIL/Total counters and the existing OverallStatus value.
    #
    # Output:
    # - A presentation-only HTML block inserted into the Report Summary section.
    #
    # Important:
    # - This does not run checks.
    # - This does not change scoring.
    # - This does not change console output.
    # - This does not change TXT report output.
    #
    # Troubleshooting rule:
    # - If the top badge looks wrong, inspect the endpoint-summary CSS classes and
    #   the values passed into this helper before changing health-check logic.

    # 05.04 Recommended Actions Helpers
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # v0.35 future slice: Recommended Actions helpers.
    # These helpers translate existing WARN/FAIL findings into review guidance.
    # They should not fix issues, run remediation, or alter the underlying check
    # results.

    # Assigns one WARN/FAIL finding to the triage bucket shown in Recommended Actions.
    #
    # Why this exists:
    # - The raw report lines are useful, but a long flat list is hard to scan.
    # - This helper lets the HTML report group problems into practical buckets,
    #   almost like a small ticket queue.
    # - It only affects the HTML Recommended Actions section. It does not change
    #   the checks themselves, the console output, or the TXT report.
    #
    # How it works:
    # - PowerShell's -match operator checks whether the finding contains certain
    #   words or phrases.
    # - The first matching bucket wins because each match immediately returns.
    # - Anything that does not match a known pattern falls back to General Findings.
    #
    # Input:
    # - Finding: One raw report line such as:
    #   [WARN]    DNS: Resolution failed
    #
    # Output:
    # - A category name used as a heading in the Recommended Actions panel.

    # Why this exists:

    # - Keeping this in one helper makes the wording easier to improve later.
    #
    # Important:

    #   and in Raw Findings.

    # Converts raw WARN/FAIL report lines into grouped action objects.
    #
    # Why this exists:
    # - The checks currently write human-readable report lines, not structured
    #   objects. That is fine for now.
    # - This function acts as a thin presentation adapter. It reads those existing
    #   lines and prepares clean objects for the HTML action panel.
    # - This avoids refactoring the check engine during v0.17.
    #
    # What gets filtered out:
    # - The SUMMARY section includes lines like "Warnings:" and "Failures:".
    #   Those are totals, not actionable findings, so they are excluded.
    # - "Overall Status" is also excluded because it is a summary label, not a
    #   specific repair item.
    #
    # Special software handling:
    # - A profile like Developer can have many missing recommended tools.
    # - Listing every missing tool inside Recommended Actions makes the action
    #   queue noisy.
    # - This function collects those missing-tool warnings and replaces them with
    #   one summarized Profile Readiness action.
    # - The full missing-tools list is still preserved in Software Readiness and
    #   Raw Findings.

    #
    # v0.23 triage rule:
    # - Recommended Actions should behave like a local triage queue.
    # - FAIL items are shown first across the entire queue, regardless of category.

    # - The original category is still shown inside each card so the technician

    # - The output is static HTML only.
    # - No JavaScript is used.

    #
    # v0.44 boundary update:

    # v0.43 boundary update:

    # presentation logic. When modularizing, extract System rendering separately
    # from Network/Software/Security/Updates rendering.

    #
    # Why this exists:
    # - The System section now groups existing endpoint evidence into familiar
    #   triage blocks: platform, vital signs, storage, process health, and core
    #   service trust.
    # - This is presentation-only. It reuses findings that were already written
    #   to the report and does not run additional system checks.
    # - Keeping this in its own helper makes the v0.24 change easier to audit or
    #   adjust without touching the console/TXT reporting path.

    # The small static Report Navigation/sidebar helpers now live in
    # scripts/ArcForge.HtmlReport.ps1. Keep the call site in this renderer so

    # placement. Do not move CSS, final template assembly, or file output as part

    # v0.35 future slices: Raw Findings and Software Readiness HTML preparation.
    # This section prepares the HTML-only view model from completed report lines.
    # Keep it after all HTML helper definitions and before the final template.
    #
    # v0.31 boundary prep:
    # - The first step below calls the report parsing layer to turn raw
    #   $ReportLines into named section collections.
    # - The assignments after that adapt parsed sections for specific HTML areas:
    #   Report Navigation, Raw Findings, System Overview/details, Software
    #   Readiness grouping, Recommended Actions, and Summary/readiness display.
    # - Future extraction should keep parsing read-only and leave visual decisions
    #   inside HTML rendering helpers.

           - They are presentation-only and reuse the same readiness data shown in
             the Readiness Overview cards.

           Important:
           - No JavaScript is involved.
           - Empty segments are muted placeholders.
           - Filled segments map to the existing readiness status:
             Critical = 1 filled segment, Attention = 2, OK = 3, No Data = 0.
           - Segment borders use a muted slate outline so empty pills stay
             visible without the harsher black border used during testing. */

           v0.18 HTML ANCHOR TARGET SPACING
           ============================================================
           These rules help the sidebar links land cleanly.

           How the sidebar jump works:
           - A sidebar link such as href="#report-summary" looks for a matching
             HTML element with id="report-summary".
           - The browser handles that jump automatically.
           - scroll-margin-top gives the jump target a little breathing room so
             the section does not land too tightly against the top of the window.

           Troubleshooting rule:
           - If a sidebar link changes the browser URL but does not visibly jump,
             confirm the matching id exists in the HTML template.

        /* v0.22 Readiness Overview dashboard card styles.
           Why this exists:
           - The Readiness Overview is the fast-scan dashboard near the top of
             the static HTML report.
           - These cards summarize the five primary readiness domains and now
             act as no-JavaScript shortcuts to the matching detailed sections.
           Important:
           - This is presentation-only.
           - These classes do not change check logic, console output, TXT report
             output, or the readiness data itself.
           Troubleshooting rule:
           - Layout/visual issue: inspect these readiness-card styles first.
           - Wrong numbers/status: inspect Get-ArcForgeSectionReadiness instead.
           - Broken card jump: confirm the href="#section-name" values match the
             detailed report section IDs. */

             Findings, or other previously shipped report modules.

             v0.18 REPORT SUMMARY MODULE
             ============================================================
             This named section groups the top summary area of the HTML report.

             Sidebar link:
             - href="#report-summary"

             Matching anchor:
             - id="report-summary"

             Why this matters:
             - The sidebar can now jump back to the top summary area without using
               a generic "Back to Top" label.
             - This keeps the HTML report modular: Report Summary, Incident Summary,
               Readiness Overview, detailed sections, Recommended Actions, and Raw Findings.

             Contains:
             - report title/status header
             - v0.20 Endpoint Summary badge
             - report ID
             - generated time
             - computer name
             - current user
             - Battlestation Profile
             - overall status
             - OK/WARN/FAIL/total check counts

            v0.21 collapsible technical depth
            Why this exists:
            - Raw Findings are still part of the HTML report, but they are no
              longer forced into the main scan path.
            - <details>/<summary> is native HTML, so this adds collapsible
              behavior without JavaScript or external dependencies.

            Important:
            - This is presentation-only.
            - This does not change check logic, console output, or TXT output.
            - The sidebar link still points to this same raw-findings section.

# 16. Report Finalization
# =============================================================================
# Future module owner: scripts/ArcForge.Runtime.ps1
# Console/TXT boundary note:
# - Write-Summary belongs to the future console/TXT report module.
# - Final "report saved" console/TXT lines are still written here because this
#   region owns final file paths and report emission.
# - Before extraction, keep the visible completion messages and TXT lines
#   byte-for-byte stable.
# Notes:
# - This region coordinates final summary, TXT output, and static HTML output.
# - Keep generated reports as untracked artifacts.
# Finalization writes the accumulated TXT buffer and then renders the static HTML
# report from the same data. Generated reports should remain untracked artifacts.
# HTML boundary note:
# - New-ArcForgeHtmlReport owns static HTML assembly for now. This finalization
#   region should only call it with completed run data and the destination path.
